# au-7.1 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Automatic Processing

## Control Statement

Provide and implement the capability to process, sort, and search audit records for events of interest based on the following content: [fields within audit records].

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[AU-07(01)[01]\] the capability to process, sort, and search audit records for events of interest based on [fields within audit records] are provided;

- \[AU-07(01)[02]\] the capability to process, sort, and search audit records for events of interest based on [fields within audit records] are implemented.

## Control guidance

Events of interest can be identified by the content of audit records, including system resources involved, information objects accessed, identities of individuals, event types, event locations, event dates and times, Internet Protocol addresses involved, or event success or failure. Organizations may define event criteria to any degree of granularity required, such as locations selectable by a general networking location or by specific system component.
