# at-4 - \[Awareness and Training\] Training Records

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Document and monitor information security and privacy training activities, including security and privacy awareness training and specific role-based security and privacy training; and

- \[b.\] Retain individual training records for [at least one (1) year or 1 year after completion of a specific training program].

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[AT-04a.\]

  - \[AT-04a.[01]\] information security and privacy training activities, including security and privacy awareness training and specific role-based security and privacy training, are documented;
  - \[AT-04a.[02]\] information security and privacy training activities, including security and privacy awareness training and specific role-based security and privacy training, are monitored;

- \[AT-04b.\] individual training records are retained for [at least one (1) year or 1 year after completion of a specific training program].

## Control guidance

Documentation for specialized training may be maintained by individual supervisors at the discretion of the organization. The National Archives and Records Administration provides guidance on records retention for federal agencies.
