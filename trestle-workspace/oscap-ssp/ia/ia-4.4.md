# ia-4.4 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Identify User Status

## Control Statement

Manage individual identifiers by uniquely identifying each individual as [contractors; foreign nationals].

## Control Assessment Objective

individual identifiers are managed by uniquely identifying each individual as [contractors; foreign nationals].

## Control guidance

Characteristics that identify the status of individuals include contractors, foreign nationals, and non-organizational users. Identifying the status of individuals by these characteristics provides additional information about the people with whom organizational personnel are communicating. For example, it might be useful for a government employee to know that one of the individuals on an email message is a contractor.
