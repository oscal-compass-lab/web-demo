# ia-8.1 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Acceptance of PIV Credentials from Other Agencies

## Control Statement

Accept and electronically verify Personal Identity Verification-compliant credentials from other federal agencies.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[IA-08(01)[01]\] Personal Identity Verification-compliant credentials from other federal agencies are accepted;

- \[IA-08(01)[02]\] Personal Identity Verification-compliant credentials from other federal agencies are electronically verified.

## Control guidance

Acceptance of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials from other federal agencies applies to both logical and physical access control systems. PIV credentials are those credentials issued by federal agencies that conform to FIPS Publication 201 and supporting guidelines. The adequacy and reliability of PIV card issuers are addressed and authorized using [SP 800-79-2](#10963761-58fc-4b20-b3d6-b44a54daba03).
