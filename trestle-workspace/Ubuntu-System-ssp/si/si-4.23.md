# si-4.23 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Host-based Devices

## Control Statement

Implement the following host-based monitoring mechanisms at [system components]: [host-based monitoring mechanisms].

## Control Assessment Objective

[host-based monitoring mechanisms] are implemented on [system components].

## Control guidance

Host-based monitoring collects information about the host (or system in which it resides). System components in which host-based monitoring can be implemented include servers, notebook computers, and mobile devices. Organizations may consider employing host-based monitoring mechanisms from multiple product developers or vendors.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

<!-- For implementation status enter one of: implemented, partial, planned, alternative, not-applicable -->

<!-- Note that the list of rules under ### Rules: is read-only and changes will not be captured after assembly to JSON -->

### This System

<!-- Add implementation prose for the main This System component for control: si-4.23 -->

#### Implementation Status: planned
